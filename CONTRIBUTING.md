# Contributing to Pol
Want to make Pol better? These are ways you can contribute:

## Ask for new media
Though Pol is free and open source, we have to follow some certain standards. If you want us to add a new media, please have this things in mind:
* Search [previous icon requests](https://github.com/IKAcc/Pol/search?type=Issues) to see if your wanted media already exists. If it was requested before, +1 it.
* Ask for a single media at a request.
* Make sure that media is notable enough.
* Title your new issue Icon request: `add: media_name` (e.g., Icon request: `add: Twitter`).

## Report a bug
We can’t claim that Pol is bug free. Please be kind and report issues in the following manner:
* Search in existing issues. We don’t want to get hundreds of duplicated reports. There are even chances that we are already working on that issue you’re facing.
* Try to reproduce issue. Make sure that issue is made up by Pol Icons and not with your other components with a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/).
* Include an example. We can fix bugs much faster if we could lay an eye upon it.

## Code CSS
Please follow these standards if you want to change some CSS:
* Multiple-line approach (one property and value per line).
* Always a space after a property's colon (.e.g, `font=size: 2rem;` and not `font-size:2rem;`).
* End all lines with a semi-colon.
* For multiple, comma-separated selectors, place each selector on its own line.
